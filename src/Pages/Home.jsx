        <h2>This is a total work in progress</h2>
        <span className='home__date'>08/27/2024</span>
        <p>While I know my way around web-dev, I am in no way a designer, as you can clearly see.  This page is NOT mobile optimized...yet. It's really just a simple react page set up. </p>
        <h2>Update...</h2>
        <span className='home__date'>2/15/2024</span>
        <p>Where does the time go?  Have not worked on this much at all... did build a fake bar that I wish I owned (maybe someday). If you want to give it a look check it out <a href="https://at-the-door.netlify.app/" alt="link to At the Door" title="link" target="_blank">At the Door</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Still looking for a real job in web dev...haven't lost hope, but it's getting there.  On a very positive note, I have lost 25lbs!!  Walking a ton and eating less works!</p>

        <h2>About me? </h2>
        <span className='home__date'>7/7/2023</span>
        <p>Aww you wanna know about me?</p>
        <p>
          Well I am an avid movie collector/watcher, mostly 4k. I know enough
          about cars to get myself in trouble when I (try to) fix them.
        </p>

          I also feel like, my site is never 'ready', partially due to not
          having much artistic skill, and when you do something for a living you
          never get time to work on your own thing. Example: Mechanic with a
          busted ride, or a house painter whos house needs painting, that sort
          of thing.
